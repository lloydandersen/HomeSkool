# HomeSkool
HomeSkool is a local network learning system for educators.

The original goals were large and will likely take many yearsâ€”most of the work outside of programming. I am currently building out learning tools for my personal use. I will gladfully append these built resources as they are made.

The app has a lot of potential. It is a barebone template for anyone to create their education management system. It has a simple login system and can easily be extended to email-secured logins. The start page has the major sections and can easily be expanded. 

What I am working on now.
-The grading system uses some files. Originally I was using SQLite, but Toml was slightly easier to implement. Also, I plan to create the lessons in Toml files. So to increase code overlap, I made every config a Toml file.
-Simple higher education lessons in random and diverse fields. I will add what I am trying to learn. The lessons may include any and everything.
